**_File Permission Commands_**

- File permission differs according to three categories
  - Owner (the user whow created the file/directory)
  - Group (to which the owner belongs to)
  - Others (all other users)
- In linux there are two ways to define permission

  - using symbols
  - using the octal notation method

- Permission
  - r(ead) has the value of 4
  - w(rite) has the value of 2
  - (e)x(ecute) has the value of 1
  - no permission(-) has the value of 0
  - using symbolic
    - `chmod u=rwx,g=rwx,o=rwx [file_name]`
  - using octal mode
    - `chmod 644 test.txt`
- File permission with `find` commands
  - `sudo find [directory] -type [d/f] -exec chmod [privilege] {} \`
  - `-type d` for directorys`-type f` for files
  - Ex: `find home -type f -exec chmod 000 {} \;`
- Change Permission of Specific Files Recursively
  - `find [directory] -name "*.[filename_extension]" -exec chmod [privilege] {} \;`
  - Ex: `find . -name "*.py" -exec chmod +x {} \;`
